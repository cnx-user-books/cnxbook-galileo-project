      Vincenzo Galilei was born in <link document="m11936">Florence</link>. He made his living as a
      lutenist, composer, theorist, singer, and teacher. Around 1560
      he settled in Pisa, where Galileo Galilei was born in 1564, the
      oldest of six or seven children. During this period Galilei also
      studied for some time in Venice under the theorist Gioseffo
      Zarlino, with whom he later had a dispute about music theory. In
      the early 1570s Galilei and his family settled in Florence. His
      prowess as a musician and theorist attracted a number of
      powerful patrons, and he often spent time at their
      residences. e.g., in 1578-79 with Duke Albrecht of Bavaria in
      Munich.

       Vincenzo Galilei published a number of books of musical scores
       for the lute and several books on musical theory. What is
       important about Galilei for our purposes is that he combined
       the practice and theory of music. Since antiquity, the theory
       of music had consisted of a mathematical discussion of harmony,
       in other words what are the mathematical ratios of the lengths
       of strings producing consonances, and how does one divide the
       octave? It had always been thought that not only was the ratio
       of lengths of two strings sounding an octave 2:1, but that so
       also was the ratio of the tensions of strings of equal lengths
       tuned an octave apart. Galilei showed that this is not the
       case: the ratio of tensions is 4:1. He found that ratio by
       hanging weights from strings. Here was an experiment that
       produced numbers and bore directly on the age-old theoretical
       discussions.

       Stillman Drake argued that Galilei performed these experiments
       in 1588, when his son Galileo was living at home and giving
       private lessons in mathematics. The implication here is that
       young Galileo actually helped in the experiments. Be that as it
       may, Galileo received from his Florentine environment in
       general and from his father in particular the tendency to
       combine practical considerations with theory and to try to
       answer theoretical questions by experiment.
