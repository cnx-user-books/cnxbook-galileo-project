     Filippo Bruno was born in Nola, near Naples, the son of Giovanni
    Bruno, a soldier, and Fraulissa Savolino. He took the name
    Giordano upon entering the Dominican order. In the great Dominican
    monastery in Naples (where Thomas Aquinas had taught), Bruno was
    instructed in Aristotelian philosophy. His exceptional expertise
    in the art of memory brought him to the attention of patrons, and
    he was brought to Rome to demonstrate his abilities to the
    Pope. During this period he may also have come under the influence
    of Giovanni Battista Della Porta, a Neapolitan <term target-id="polymath">polymath</term> who
    published an important book on natural magic. Bruno was attracted
    to new streams of thought, among which were the works of Plato and
    Hermes Trismegistus, both resurrected in Florence by Marsilio
    Ficino in the late fifteenth century. Hermes Trismegistus was
    thought to be a gentile prophet who was a contemporary of
    Moses. The works attributed to him in fact date from the turn of
    the Christian era.

       Because of his heterodox tendencies, Bruno came to the
       attention of the <link document="m11944">Inquisition</link> in Naples and in 1576 he left the
       city to escape prosecution. When the same happened in Rome, he
       fled again, this time abandoning his Dominican habit. For the
       next seven years he lived in France, lecturing on various
       subjects and attracting the attention of powerful patrons. From
       1583 to 1585 he lived at the house of the French ambassador in
       London. During this period he published the books that are most
       important for our purposes, <cite><cite-title>Cena de le Ceneri</cite-title></cite> ("The Ash
       Wednesday Supper") and <cite><cite-title>De l'Infinito, Universo e Mondi</cite-title></cite> ("On the
       Infinite Universe and Worlds"), both published in 1584. In <cite><cite-title>Cena
       de le Ceneri</cite-title></cite>, Bruno defended the heliocentric theory of
       <link document="m11938">Copernicus</link> . It appears that he did not understand astronomy
       very well, for his theory is confused on several points. In De
       l'Infinito , Universo e Mondi, he argued that the universe was
       infinite, that it contained an infinite number of worlds, and
       that these are all inhabited by intelligent beings.

       Wherever he went, Bruno's passionate utterings led to
       opposition. During his English period he outraged the Oxford
       faculty in a lecture at the university; upon his return to
       France, in 1585, he got into a violent quarrel about a
       scientific instrument. He fled Paris for Germany in 1586, where
       he lived in Wittenberg, Prague, Helmstedt, and Frankfurt. As he
       had in France and England, he lived off the munificence of
       patrons, whom after some time he invariably outraged. In 1591
       he accepted an invitation to live in Venice. Here he was
       arrested by the Inquisition and tried. After he had recanted,
       Bruno was sent to Rome, in 1592, for another trial. For eight
       years he was kept imprisoned and interrogated
       periodically. When, in the end, he refused to recant, he was
       declared a heretic and burned at the stake.
    </para>
		<para id="para4">
       It is often maintained that Bruno was executed because of his
       Copernicanism and his belief in the infinity of inhabited
       worlds. In fact, we do not know the exact grounds on which he
       was declared a heretic because his file is missing from the
       records. Scientists such as Galileo and <link document="m11962">Johannes Kepler</link> were
       not sympathetic to Bruno in their writings.
